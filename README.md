This repository contains the folder and files created for the FIX MY CODE CHALLENGE Files. Fix my code is a new type of project, where we'll jump into an existing code base and fix it! This is done using pre-written repos as initial files for all solutions. I'm not coding anything new, just fixing the existing code base.


This was a project provided by ALX in which I was challenged with debugging various programs. The challenges spanned a variety of programming languages from C to Python to Javascript to Ruby and more, some of which I was familiar with, others of which I was not. The specific list of projects contained as follows:
